User: make funny joke. Why did the chicken cross the road?
assistant: Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the silly sideshow!
User: can anything travel fatser than the speed of light? please explain your reasoning.
assistant: According to our current understanding of physics, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. This is because the speed of light is a fundamental constant of the universe and is one of the pillars of the theory of Special Relativity. As an object approaches the speed of light, its mass increases, making it harder and harder to accelerate. At the speed of light, an object's mass would become infinite, making it impossible to accelerate any further. This phenomenon is known as time dilation, and it means that for an object traveling at or near the speed of light, time appears to slow down. Therefore, it is not possible for anything, including particles, matter or information, to travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum.
User: flying pigs
User: flying pigs
assistant: In a land far away, where dreams come to life,
There lies a majestic sight, beyond all strife.
Up in the sky, they soar and they fly,
The pigs with wings, way up high.

Their trotters spread wide, their wings take flight,
Gazing upon them, such an incredible sight.
The sky they conquer with ease,
Amusing all who watch, hearts at ease.

Through rainbows and clouds, they glide and they sway,
Flying without a worry, all worries tucked away.
Far from any stress or pain,
They revel in this newfound fame.

Some may scoff and say "pigs can't fly",
But they're proven wrong as they pass by.
In this land where anything's possible,
Flying pigs are just plausible.

So here's a secret for us to keep,
Of these flying pigs, we have to sneak a peep.
Let us join them, let's soar with delight,
And let our spirits take a majestic flight.

User: integration of a formula is algebraically impossible
assistant: 1. The integral of e^(x^2) does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions.
2. The integral of sin(x)/x does not have an antiderivative expressible in elementary functions.
3. The integral of ln(x) does not have an elementary antiderivative.
4. The integral of e^(-x^2) over the entire real line cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.
5. The integral of x^x cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.
